*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*

A generic medicine is developed to be the same as a medicine that has already been authorised, called the reference medicine. A generic medicine contains the same active substance (s) as the reference medicine, and it is used at the same dose (s) to treat the same disease(s). A generic drug must contain the same active ingredients as the original brand name formulation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires generics to be identical to or within an acceptable bioequivalent range of their brand name counterparts, concerning pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.

*PROBLEMS*
 
Price benefits Generic medicines are more affordable than non-generic medicines. You can save money significantly by purchasing generic medicines.
As per the WHO recommendation, the availability of EMs should be 100%, Availability of generic medicines in public sectors is less than 60% across WHO regions, especially in Africa region [ 20 ].
In the United States, 9 out of 10 prescriptions filled are for generic drugs. Increasing the availability of generic drugs helps to create competition in the marketplace, which then helps to make treatment more affordable and increases access to healthcare for more patients.

*METHODOLOGIES*
 
Secure and reliable platform: The online store should be built on a secure and reliable platform that uses encryption technologies to protect customers' personal and financial information.

Legality: The sale of certain generic medicines may be illegal in some countries, and patients may be at risk of legal action or penalties for purchasing these drugs online.

Verification problems: Patients may have difficulty verifying the authenticity and quality of the generic medicines they purchase online, leading to uncertainty about their effectiveness and safety.

Online consultation: The website could offer online consultation services with licensed healthcare professionals to help customers choose the right generic medicines for their needs.
